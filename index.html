			I found a love for me
			Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
			I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
			I never knew you were 
			The someone waiting for me
			'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
			Not knowing what it was
			I will not give you up this time
			But darling, just kiss me slow, 
			Your heart is all I own
			And in your eyes, you're holding mine
		</p>
